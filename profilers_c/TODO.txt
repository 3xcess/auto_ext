1. Makefile for the complete folder
2. Each profiler currently imports vmlinux from its own folder, change that to a unified import
3. Might generate vmlinux directly from makefile during first run
4. Update the dispatcher and eval programs:
   |-+ Might first try just updating a copy of the current python dispatcher
   | |-Eventually want to write a complete C alternative, if possible using scx
   |
   |-+ Will also need to update start.sh

NOT URGENT:
>_ Add a performance overhead check
>_ Compare performance with the python counterpart once overhead check is implemented
